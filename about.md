That's a question! Who am I?

In my professional life, I'm a software developer (what a surprise).

I'm also an OOP (+ RAII, SOLID, ...) lover. And a C++ / Go lover too. I'm passionate about programming and new technologies.

PS: Even if this blog is in English, my posts are most of the time in French (sorry guys).
