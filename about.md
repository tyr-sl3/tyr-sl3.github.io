That's a question! Who am I?

In my professional life, I'm a software engineer, working on an SaaS solution about document delivery.

I'm also an OOP (+ RAII, SOLID, ...) lover. And a C++11/14/17 (+ STL, Boost, CUDA, SFML) lover too. I'm passionate about programming (paradigms, design patterns) and new technologies.

PS: Even if this blog is in English, my articles are most of the time in French (sorry guys).
